## How to Collaborate:

1. Fork the repository to your own GitHub account.

2. Clone the repository to your local machine
```
$ git clone "https://www.github.com/{Username}/Algorithms.git"
```
where username is your GitHub account username.

3. Create a branch where you can do your local work.
Never work on **master** branch as we do not allow master commits except by admins.
```
$ git branch {branchname}
$ git checkout branchname
```

4. Do your work and stage your changes.
```
$ git add <filename>
```

5. Commit you changes with a commit message containing your name, file(s) worked upon, changes added.

6. Push changes to your forked repository
```
$ git push -u origin branchname
```
7. Create a pull request to the upstream repository.

## Synchronize forked repository with Upstream repository

1. Create upstream as our repository
```
$ git remote add upstream "https://www.github.com/ekdnam/Algorithms"
```

2. Fetch upstream changes in local machine
```
$ git fetch upstream
```

3. Switch to master branch
```
$ git checkout master
```

4. Merge changes in local machine
```
$ git merge upstream/master
```

5. Push changes to your forked GitHub repository
```
$ git push -f origin master
```
