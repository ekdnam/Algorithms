## What is A* Search Algorithm? 
A* Search algorithm is one of the best and popular technique used in path-finding and graph traversals.

## Why A* Search Algorithm ? #
Informally speaking, A* Search algorithms, unlike other traversal techniques, it has “brains”. What it means is that it is really a smart algorithm which separates it from the other conventional algorithms. This fact is cleared in detail in below sections.
And it is also worth mentioning that many games and web-based maps use this algorithm to find the shortest path very efficiently (approximation).

### Explanation:- ## 
Consider a square grid having many obstacles and we are given a starting cell and a target cell. We want to reach the target cell (if possible) from the starting cell as quickly as possible. Here A* Search Algorithm comes to the rescue.

What A* Search Algorithm does is that at each step it picks the node according to a value-‘f’ which is a parameter equal to the sum of two other parameters – ‘g’ and ‘h’. At each step it picks the node/cell having the lowest ‘f’, and process that node/cell.

We define ‘g’ and ‘h’ as simply as possible below

g = the movement cost to move from the starting point to a given square on the grid, following the path generated to get there.
h = the estimated movement cost to move from that given square on the grid to the final destination. This is often referred to as the heuristic, which is nothing but a kind of smart guess. We really don’t know the actual distance until we find the path, because all sorts of things can be in the way (walls, water, etc.). There can be many ways to calculate this ‘h’ which are discussed in the later sections.


## Algorithm 
We create two lists – Open List and Closed List (just like Dijkstra Algorithm)

```
A* Search Algorithm
1.  Initialize the open list
2.  Initialize the closed list
    put the starting node on the open 
    list (you can leave its f at zero)

3.  while the open list is not empty
    a) find the node with the least f on 
       the open list, call it "q"

    b) pop q off the open list
  
    c) generate q's 8 successors and set their 
       parents to q
   
    d) for each successor
        
        i) if successor is the goal, stop search
          successor.g = q.g + distance between 
                              successor and q
          successor.h = distance from goal to 
          successor (This can be done using many 
          ways, we will discuss three heuristics- 
          Manhattan, Diagonal and Euclidean 
          Heuristics)
          
          successor.f = successor.g + successor.h

        ii) if a node with the same position as 
            successor is in the OPEN list which has a 
           lower f than successor, skip this successor

        iii) if a node with the same position as 
            successor  is in the CLOSED list which has
            a lower f than successor, skip this successor
            otherwise, add  the node to the open list
     end (for loop)
  
    e) push q on the closed list
    end (while loop
```
