# Dijkstra Algorithm

You are given a directed or undirected weighted graph with n vertices and m edges. The weights of all edges are non-negative. You are also given a starting vertex s. This article discusses finding the lengths of the shortest paths from a starting vertex s to all other vertices, and output the shortest paths themselves.
This problem is also called **single-source shortest paths problem**.

## Algorithm
Let's create an array d[] where for each vertex v we store the current length of the shortest path from s to v in d[v]. Initially d[s]=0, and for all other vertices this length equals infinity. In the implementation a sufficiently large number (which is guaranteed to be greater than any possible path length) is chosen as infinity.

```
d[v]=∞, v≠s
```
In addition, we maintain a Boolean array u[] which stores for each vertex v whether it's marked. Initially all vertices are unmarked:
```
u[v]=false
```
The Dijkstra's algorithm runs for n iterations. At each iteration a vertex v is chosen as unmarked vertex which has the least value d[v]:

Evidently, in the first iteration the starting vertex s will be selected.

The selected vertex v is marked. Next, from vertex v relaxations are performed: all edges of the form (v,to) are considered, and for each vertex to the algorithm tries to improve the value d[to]. If the length of the current edge equals len, the code for relaxation is:
```
d[to]=min(d[to],d[v]+len)
```
After all such edges are considered, the current iteration ends. Finally, after n iterations, all vertices will be marked, and the algorithm terminates. We claim that the found values d[v] are the lengths of shortest paths from s to all vertices v.

Note that if some vertices are unreachable from the starting vertex s, the values d[v] for them will remain infinite. Obviously, the last few iterations of the algorithm will choose those vertices, but no useful work will be done for them. Therefore, the algorithm can be stopped as soon as the selected vertex has infinite distance to it.

**Restoring Shortest Paths**

Usually one needs to know not only the lengths of shortest paths but also the shortest paths themselves. Let's see how to maintain sufficient information to restore the shortest path from s to any vertex. We'll maintain an array of predecessors p[] in which for each vertex v≠s p[v] is the penultimate vertex in the shortest path from s to v. Here we use the fact that if we take the shortest path to some vertex v and remove v from this path, we'll get a path ending in at vertex p[v], and this path will be the shortest for the vertex p[v]. This array of predecessors can be used to restore the shortest path to any vertex: starting with v, repeatedly take the predecessor of the current vertex until we reach the starting vertex s to get the required shortest path with vertices listed in reverse order. So, the shortest path P to the vertex v is equal to:

```
P=(s,…,p[p[p[v]]],p[p[v]],p[v],v)
```
Building this array of predecessors is very simple: for each successful relaxation, i.e. when for some selected vertex v, there is an improvement in the distance to some vertex to, we update the predecessor vertex for to with vertex v:

```
p[to]=v
``` 
**Time Complexity of Dijkstra Algorithm**

Time complexity of Dijkstra's Algorithm changes with the method of implementation of the priority queue. Using Min Heap time complexity of O(V + E log V) can be acheived. Using array implementation of priority queue time complexity of O(V^2) can be acheived. Most efficient implemenatation of priority queue in terms of time complexity is using Fibonacci Heap which yeilds results in O(E + V log V).
