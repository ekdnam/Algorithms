# C Program for Fibonacci numbers

The Fibonacci numbers are the numbers in the following integer sequence.

0, 1, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13, 21, 34, 55, 89, 144, ……..

In mathematical terms, the sequence Fn of Fibonacci numbers is defined by the recurrence relation

                        Fn = Fn-1 + Fn-2  
    with seed values:
                        Fo = 0 and F1 = 1.
