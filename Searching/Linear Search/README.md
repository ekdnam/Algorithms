Linear search (Searching algorithm) is used to find whether a given number is present in an array and if it is present then at what location it occurs.
It is also known as sequential search.
It is straightforward and works as follows: We keep on comparing each element with the element to search until it is found or otherwise the search continues till the end of the data collection.
It is one of the easiest searching algorithm.
The time complexity of Linear search is:
a. Best case = O(1)
b. Average case = n(n+1)/2n = O(n)
c. Worst case = O(n)
And,
The space complexity of Linear Search is O(1)
