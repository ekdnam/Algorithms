**********LINEAR SEARCH*********

It is also called sequential search.
1) In this search technique , we start at the beginning of the list or the table and serch for the desired record
   by examining ech subsequent record untill either the desired record is found or the list is exhausted.
2) on an average the number of comparision will be (n+1)/2
3) The worst case efficiency of this algorithm is O(n)

ALGORITHM
algorithm SEQSEARCH(L[],N,ITEM)
1. [initialize]
 Set Flag=1.
2. [Loop]
 Repeat step3 for K=0,1,2,......,N-1
3.If L[K] == ITEM
    a) set Flag=0
    b) write "search successful"
4.If Flag == 1 then: write "search unsuccessful"
5. [finished]
 Exit.
